This projects aims to develop an Optical Character Recognizer that can recognize Bangla Scripts. This project will contain the necessary contents for the research and development of a Bangla / Bengali OCR. This will equally focus on building necessary tools that will eventually help on OCR development.

Few of the documents related to BanglaOCR development is posted on our blog: http://crblpocr.blogspot.com/
